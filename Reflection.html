			<p> Student life is the most critical and golden phase of development; it is the time when the character of an adolescent is formed; It is the duration in which his character is built; 
			A teenager's thinking is like a lump of clay and is uniquely shaped over the course of college. School life is one of joy and happiness for college students 
			as they can be freed from the problems and stresses of life. It is important that college students seek skills and gather accurate information during this time. <br> <br>
Student life at the university enables them to master almost anything. They research educational information, manners, accurate behavior, discipline, punctuality, and more. 
When properly trained and instructed, they will grow into well-behaved adults. Them with obligations for the foreign sector. It sets the inspiration for a little boy's boom 
and overcoming any man or woman and information.

		<p>  The student's existence teaches a young child in regularity, obedience, sincerity, and tolerance. They investigate what is right
 and what is terrible. They learn social mastery and improve their social skills from their peers. In addition, they will discover ways to tell the differences in different college 
 students by following their personal norms and values. <br> <br>
 Adjusting to life at university is a huge change, both in terms of academic work and adapting to life away from home. It can feel daunting, but there are lots of 
	things you can do to make the transition from school learning to university studies as smooth as possible. As a student you have to wake up every day with the goal 
	of completing something that has got to do with your school work. If that is some tasks that have to be handed in, or some task that you yourself want to do. The school
	work can get somewhat dry after a while, doing some alternative side projects every now and then can be useful to keeping motivation and learning in an alternative way. <br> <br>
You have to set yourself some routines! Motivation comes and goes, routines are always there. There are less hours of teaching and more hours of individual work. You have to keep 
doing your routine so you can stay on top of things. With good routines, comes good grades - you can quote me on that! When learning to code for the first time, you have to have grit. 
You cannot give up as it gets hard, all of a sudden you will understand it and that feeling cannot be matched! Try doing some fun programming projects that are outside of regular  
school work, this way you get to see what fun things you can do with programming, not only the “boring” stuff that they show you in school. Googling “fun beginner "programming language" 
projects” is a good start to find some alternative learning sources. It helps with motivation to do these alternative projects, so I highly recommend doing them! <br> <br>
Remember to be social from the get-go, having friends is vital to keep motivation and not to drop out.
