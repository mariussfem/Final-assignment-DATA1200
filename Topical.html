        <p>The biggest difference anyone can make to stop the spread of mis- and disinformation
            is on an individual level. There are a few key points on which everyone can improve
            on to become less susceptible to false information and <i>“fake news”</i>.
            These points that we will discuss works on both a personal and a professional level
            and should be strived for.</p>
<br>
        <p>We believe that the biggest change an individual can make is to educate oneself.
            This means that we should take the time to understand the tricks and methods
            people use to try and manipulate us. As said in the article;
            <i>“...familiarizing yourself with the tricks of the disinformation trade...</i>”
            (Colleen, 2021), is an effective way of recognizing falsehoods before even
            starting to read.
        </p>

				<p>However, another big reason why mis- and especially disinformation spreads so rapidly
				is the emotional aspects. <i>“fake news”</i> often uses this trick to great effect
				on many instances. We should be aware of our emotions before we read online,
				especially when reading something we are passionate about.
				<i>“Research has found people are more susceptible to misinformation that aligns with their
                pre-existing views. This is called <strong>confirmation bias</strong>...”</i>
				(Colleen, 2021), therefore we should be aware of any pre-existing personal biases
				we might have and try to approach it with a neutral standpoint without getting emotional.
				</p>
	<br>

				<p>One obvious point is that we should consider the sources.
				If there are no sources that directly connect to the content that is discussed,
				we should immediately become skeptical. We should consider whether the sources are
				trustworthy or not. We should also consider looking at multiple sources at the same time
				to confirm or refute if a source is reliable and trustworthy.</p>
